            As long as I can remember I've felt overwhelmed with enormous amounts of energy. There
            was always so much to do and so much to think about. I couldn't relax and I couldn't
            focus.
          </p>
          <p>
            One day, I made a simple checklist to organize the chaos in my mind and for the first
            time I felt relaxed, organized and focused. So, I started making more checklists. The
            more checklists I made, the less anxiety I felt.
          </p>
          <p>
            Think of checklists as a plugin for the mind. They help us remember and organize the
            endless list of things we have to do and want to do.
