        <p>As long as I can remember I've felt overwhelmed with enormous amounts of energy. There was always so much to do
          and so much to think about. I couldn't relax and I couldn't focus.</p>
        <p>One day, I made a simple checklist to organize the chaos in my mind and for the first time I felt relaxed,
          organized and focused. So, I started making more checklists. The more checklists I made, the less anxiety I felt.
        </p>
        <p>Think of checklists as a plugin for the mind. They help us remember and organize the endless list of things we
          have to do and want to do.</p>
